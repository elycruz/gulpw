I.)  Brainstorming:
    1.)  Types of TaskProxies/TaskAdapters that exists are:
        - TaskProxy           - Task Proxies that implement represent a gulp plugin.
        - TaskProxy           - Task Proxies that represent one or many node modules.
        - CompositeTaskProxy  - Task Proxies that represent multiple gulp plugins.
        - CompositeTaskProxy  - Task Proxies that represent multiple node modules and gulp plugins.
        - StaticTaskProxy     - Task Proxies that do not represent any node modules or gulp plugins.

    2.) Suggested directories for default setup:
        - bundle-configs/
        - gulpw-config.yaml
        - bundle-wrangler-configs/

    3.) How do we allow users to have a config and not merge their config


#      # Hostname to develop for:
#      gulpw-sample.somedomain.com:
#
#        # Servers where user can develop for `domainToDevelopFor` (in the case that this domain is the one chosen
#        # for development (in the `gulpw deploy-config` prompt then `domainToDevelopFor` is equal to the
#        # value of `gulpw-sample.somedomain.com`)
#        hostnames: # slots/hosts
#          - -devslot1.gulpw-sample.somedomain.com
#          - -devslot2.gulpw-sample.somedomain.com
#          - -devslot3.gulpw-sample.somedomain.com
#
#        # All website instance prefixes represent the same website just different
#        # instances of the website.
#
#        # Array of possible prefixes per `hostname` (in above `hostnames`)
#        hostnamePrefixes:
#          - web1
#          - web2
#          - web3
#
#        # If set will be passed to all/any of the following template vars: `deployRootFolder`,
#        # `deployRootFoldersByFileType[x]` (where `x` is the 'key' of a key within the hash map);
#        hostnamePrefixFolders: null
#          #web1: website1
#          #web2: website2
#          #web3: website3
#
#        # @note deployRoot quirk/caveat: All paths for deployRootFolder and it's file type variant must use absolute paths
#
#        # Root folder on the server to use for deployments (used as a prefix path for file paths being deployed)
#        # example: /home/some-user/sites/<%= hostnamePrefix %><%= hostname %> (recieves the `deploy` has from this config)
#        deployRootFolder: null
#
#        # Deploy roots by file types;  E.g., File types can have different deploy roots or can be deployed to
#        # any directory within the remote server's file system via this hash map.
#        #deployRootFoldersByFileType: null
#        #  jsp: ...
#        #  php: ...
