### Setup
1. Create your project's bundle configs folder;  E.g., './bundle-configs' etc.
2. Call `gulpw` from your projects root (a `gulpw-config.*` file will be generated there).
    Then run `gulpw config` to help populate the file (file can be customzied manually instead).
3. Tell your `gulpw-config.*` file where your bundle configs folder is: Set `bundlesPath` to your bundles config path.
5. Configure your global tasks within your `gulpw-config.*` file.
6. (Optional) Execute `gulpw deploy-config` to configure servers to deploy your work to.
7. Reap the benefits of using gulpw.
