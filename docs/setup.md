### Setup
1. Create your project's bundle configs folder;  E.g., './gulpw-bundle-configs' etc.
2. Create empty `gulpw-config.*` config file or run `gulpw config` in your projects root to generate one.
3. Tell your `gulpw-config.*` file where your bundle configs folder is (set `bundlesPath` to your bundles config path inside config file).
5. Configure your global tasks within your `gulpw-config.*` file.
6. (Optional) Execute `gulpw deploy-config` to configure servers to deploy your work to.
7. Reap the benefits of using gulpw.
